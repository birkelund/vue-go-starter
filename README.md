# vue-go-starter

This is a simple single-page application built with Vue for the frontend, a Go
server as backend and deployed as a single binary through statik.

This example requires yarn, go and statik.

## Building

Because the package generated by statik is not included in this repository,
this project is not `go get`'able.

    mkdir $GOPATH/github.com/birkelund
    cd !$
    git clone https://github.com/birkelund/vue-go-starter
    cd vue-go-starter
    make


## Running

Run the `vue-go-starter` binary and visit http://localhost:8080.
